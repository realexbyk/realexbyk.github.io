# Alexander Bykovskiy - Data Analytics Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Alex and based in the UAE! I love working with data and here you will find some of my projects. I have a background in construction, working as a Project Manger/Analyst on an environmental project. During my Master's studies in 2019 I had to perform a lot data collection and anlysis, as well as annotate and train neural netweork for my thesis. This started my data analystics journey. Through my research and work I have experience in conducting statistical tests, and forecasting based on linear models, and also know the methods of bootstrap analysis, A/B and A/A testing.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### E-commerce Clients analysis
**Code:** [`#.ipynb`]()    
**Description:** Analysis of e-commerce site delivery and customer segmentation  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Segmented customers  

### Computer Vision to Track Construction Progress
**Code:** [`https://github.com/realexbyk/RebarStateModel/blob/master/annotation.py`](https://github.com/realexbyk/RebarStateModel)    
**Description:** Collected Data and trained Neural Network to track rebar installation progress on construction site.  
**Skills:** annotation, neural network, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Published paper in "Automation in Construction" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580522003211 

## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.



### Currently Studying
**Description:** Here are some things I'm currently studying


### Tableau Vizzes
**Description:** My Tableau Public account ---> [go to Tableau..](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexander2895)  
**Status:** âˆž  

### Useful Code Snippets
**Description:** Here are some good code snippets which coud be used in analysis
**Repository:**
**Status:** âˆž  


## Certificates
I belive that the best way to learn is to do projects, however here are some relevant certificates which helped me learn certain skills:
- [Data Science for Construction, Architecture and Engineering](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/72e22d463cde4ba3b83255fa67d3ce23) (Aug 2020)
